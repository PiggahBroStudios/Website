To solve this problem, we decided it was a good idea to make this game into a real thing. Dylan Bulmer, lead programmer for this game, started developing the game right away and throughout the process others including: Tyler Kleiser and Spencer Dowd helped debug and suggest details and improvements to be added. With hard work and some outside help the game is close to finished."
